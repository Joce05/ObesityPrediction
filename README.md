# Obesity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict obesity levels based on various health and lifestyle factors, utilizing three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of over 99% (Random Forest and Decision Tree) and 91% (KNN), and Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation is used to ensure a balanced evaluation across all classes.

Project Overview
Obesity is a complex health condition influenced by various lifestyle and genetic factors. This project builds and evaluates three machine learning models to classify individuals into obesity categories.

Methods
Three machine learning methods are implemented and compared:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based classifier that assigns labels based on the nearest neighbors.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them for better accuracy.
Decision Tree: A tree-structured model that makes decisions based on feature splits to classify instances.
Cross-Validation
The model evaluation uses Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure each fold has a balanced representation of all classes, resulting in more reliable accuracy metrics.
